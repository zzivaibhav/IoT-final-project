## Project Overview
This project implements a lightweight, asynchronous messaging protocol for LoRaWAN devices. The system allows TTGO LoRa32 devices to discover other active devices and send messages to them through a centralized application server.

## Directory Structure
- **firmware/**: Contains device firmware
  - **code/code.ino**: Main firmware for TTGO LoRa32 boards
- **server/**: Server-side code
  - **server.py**: Application server that handles device communication
  - **new_server.py**: Alternative server implementation
  - **data/**: Server logs and data
- **data/**: Analysis data

## Hardware Setup
- 2Ã— TTGO LoRa32 boards
- USB cables for programming and power
- Antennas (if not integrated)

## Software Dependencies
- Arduino IDE
- Libraries:
  - MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC library (v4.0.0 or newer)
  - ArduinoJson (v6.18.0 or newer)
- Python 3.8+ (for server)
- Python packages:
  - paho-mqtt
  - json
  - datetime
  - threading

## Setup and Execution Instructions

### Setting up the TTGO LoRa32 Devices
1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Add ESP32 board support: 
   - Go to File > Preferences
   - Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json` to Additional Boards URLs
3. Install required libraries:
   - Tools > Manage Libraries > Search "MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC" and install
   - Tools > Manage Libraries > Search "ArduinoJson" and install
4. Open the code.ino file in Arduino IDE
5. Select board: Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > TTGO LoRa32
6. Connect the TTGO LoRa32 board via USB
7. Select the correct port under Tools > Port
8. Click Upload

### Setting up The Things Network (TTN)
1. Create an account on The Things Network
2. Create a new application
3. Register your devices with the AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey values used in the code
4. Ensure the devices are properly registered and activated

### Running the Server
1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Install required packages: `pip install paho-mqtt`
3. Update the TTN credentials in server.py:
   - TTN_USERNAME (your app ID)
   - TTN_PASSWORD (your API key)
   - TTN_APP_ID (your app ID)
4. Run the server: `python server.py`

## Using the Device
After flashing the firmware and joining the network, the TTGO LoRa32 will:
- Send keepalive messages every 60 seconds
- Allow command input via Serial Monitor

Commands:
- `D` - Send DISCOVER to get active devices
- `L` - List active devices from last roster
- `T<index>` - Select target device by index (e.g., `T0` to select the first device)
- `C:<message>` - Send message to selected target (e.g., `C:Hello!`)

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting
- If a device fails to join TTN, check the credentials and ensure the device is properly registered
- Downlink messages may be delayed based on LoRaWAN Class A restrictions
- Maximum message length is limited by LoRaWAN payload restrictions
